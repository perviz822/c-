Exercise
--------

* Write a manipulator with the name "abcitem", with which list items can be
  enumerated with small letters.
  e.g.
    cout << abcitem << ". element" << endl;
  
* Write an effector with the name "backwards", which gets a string parameter
  and writes it backwards to the stream.
  e.g. 
    cout << backwards("something") << endl;  // -> gnihtemos

* Write two manipulators - with the names "backwardsBegin" and "backwardsEnd" -
  so that all strings between these two in the stream will be written backwards
  to the stream.
  e.g. 
    cout << backwardsBegin << "something" << backwardsEnd <<endl;  // -> gnihtemos

* Write an effector with the name "matrix", which gets an arbitrary sized
  two-dimensional array and writes it formatted as a table to the stream.
  e.g.
    const int N=3;
    const int M=4;
    int m[N][M] = {
      1, 2, 3, 4,
      5, 6, 7, 8,
      9,10,11,12
    };
    cout << matrix<N,M>(m) << endl;
